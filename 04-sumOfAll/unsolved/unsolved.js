// White a function that will take in an array of two integers.
// Have that function return the total of those two integers AND any integers in between them.
// NOTE: Make it work even if the lower number is not first in the array.
// HINT: Look into Math.min() and Math.max().
// Consider Array.prototype.reduce() to get the final sum!
